USE

The Steam Group Chat Bot acts a lot like a simple version of IRC. If you're familiar with
IRC you'll feel right at home.

Connecting to the bot
----------------------
Simply send the bot a friend request. If the bot's friends list is full, the bot owner
will normally launch another instance of the bot and you can add the alternate bot to your
friends list. The bot will instantly add you back.

You will be dropped into the partyline channel. This channel is where everyone goes on
first connect. To talk to people in the channel, just message the bot, your message will
get relayed to everyone on the channel.

To see who's on the channel type "/status" (minus the quotes). You'll get a list of 
everyone on the channel.

If the spam on the channel gets to be too much, type "/off". You will be put "offline". If
you're ready to get messages again, just type "/on".

To see a list of available channels, just type "/list".

To join one of the channels, type "/join channelname" (replacing channelname with the name
of the channel you want to join.

If you're the bot admin type "/g message goes here" (replacing message goes here with a 
message) to broadcast a message to everybody connected to the bot.

If you want a list of commands, just type "/help".

Good luck!
