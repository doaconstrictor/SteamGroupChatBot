SETUP

Prerequisites
-------------
You're going to need the .NET framework or Mono. Personally, I have only tested with Mono
so your milage may vary.

1. If you're just concerned about deploying all the files you need are going to be in
the bin/Release folder. Everything else is just source code that you don't really need.

2. Edit the channels.cfg file and the settings.cfg files. Instructions will be inside the
files.

3. Run the executable. I would suggest running it inside a screen session so that you can
log off if you're running the bot on a VPS or remote server.

4. You will be presented with the bot console. Start by launching a Steam instance by
typing "addbot" (minus the quotes).

5. You will be prompted for a Steam username and password. This account will be controlled
by the framework. Unfortunately, you will want to turn off Steam Guard, otherwise the bot
will be unable to login.

6. Add the bot to your friends list, if everything was successful, the bot should accept
your request and you will be able to relay messages!

Bot console commands
---------------------

- addbot | Adds another Steam instance. If one bot's Steam account's friends list fills up
you can add another Steam account to be controlled.

- killbot | Let's you kill a Steam instance that is acting up.

- global <text to broadcast> | Broadcasts a message to every user connected to the bots.

- quit | Ends the bot. You should always quit the bot with this command.

That's it! If you need any help feel free to contact me. You can find my contact info in
the README file.
